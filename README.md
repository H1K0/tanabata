## About

Tanabata (_jp._ ä¸ƒå¤•) is Japanese festival. People generally celebrate this day by writing wishes, sometimes in the form of poetry, on _tanzaku_ (_jp._ çŸ­å†Š), small pieces of paper, and hanging them on _sasa_ (_jp._ ç¬¹), bamboo. See [this Wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tanabata) for more information.

Tanabata Project is a software project that will let you enjoy the Tanabata festival. It allows you to store and organize your data as _sasa_ bamboos, on which you can hang almost any number of _tanzaku_, just like adding tags on it.
