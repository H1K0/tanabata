## About

Tanabata (_jp._ 七夕) is a Japanese festival. People generally celebrate this day by writing wishes, sometimes in the form of poetry, on _tanzaku_ (_jp._ 短冊), small pieces of paper, and hanging them on _sasa_ (_jp._ 笹), bamboo. See [this Wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tanabata) for more information.

Tanabata FM is a file manager for Linux that will let you enjoy the Tanabata festival. It organizes files as _sasa_ bamboos, on which you can hang almost any number of _tanzaku_, just like adding tags on it.

By now, there is only the core of Tanabata FM.
