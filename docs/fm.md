# Tanabata File Manager

## Usage

### Command Line Interface

Build the CLI app using `./build.sh -t tfm [-b <build_dir>]`. For better experience, you can move the executable to the `/usr/bin/` directory (totally safe unless you have another app named `tfm`) or add the directory with it to `PATH`.

Then just open the terminal and run `tfm -h`. If you are running it for the first time, run it with `sudo` or manually create the `/etc/tanabata/` directory and check its permissions. This is the directory where Tanabata programs store their configuration files. If everything is set up properly, you should get the following help message.

So, let's take a look at each option.

Using the `-I <dir>` option, you can initialize an empty TFM database in the specified directory. The app creates empty sasahyou, sappyou and shoppyou files and saves the directory path to the configuration file. The new database will be used the next time you run the app until you change it.

Using the `-O <dir>` option, you can open an existing TFM database in the specified directory. The app checks if the directory contains sasahyou, sappyou and shoppyou files, and if they exist and are valid, saves the directory path to the configuration file. The new database will be used the next time you run the app until you change it.

Using the `-i` option, you can get info about your database. When your hyous were created and last modified, how many records and holes they have, and so on.

Using the `-s` option, you can add new sasa, tanzaku, or kazari.

Using the `-u` option, you can remove sasa, tanzaku, or kazari.

Using the `-e` option, you can update sasa file path or tanzaku name or description. If you want to keep the current value of a field (for example, if you want to change the description of tanzaku while keeping its name), just leave its line blank.

Using the `-f` option, you can manage your sasa. It takes sasa ID when used alone or with the `-u` or `-e` option or target file path when used with the `-s` option. If you want to view the list of all sasa, pass `.` as an argument. For example, `tfm -f 2d` prints the info about sasa with ID `2d` and `tfm -sf path/to/file` adds a new file to the database.

Using the `-t` option, you can manage your tanzaku. It takes tanzaku ID when used alone or with the `-u` or `-e` option or the name of new tanzaku when used with the `-s` option. If you want to view the list of all tanzaku, pass `.` as an argument. For example, `tfm -t c4` prints the info about sasa with ID `c4` and `tfm -st "New tag name"` adds a new tanzaku to the database.

The `-c` option can be used only with the `-s` or `-u` option. It takes the IDs of sasa and tanzaku to link/unlink separated with a hyphen. For example, `tfm -sc 10-4d` links sasa with ID `10` and tanzaku with ID `4d`.

Using the `-w` option, you can _weed_ the database. It's like defragmentation. For example, if you had 4 files with sasa IDs 0, 1, 2, 3 in your database and removed the 1st one, then your database would only have sasa IDs 0, 2, 3 and ID 1 would be a _hole_. Weeding fixes this hole by changing sasa ID 2 to 1, 3 to 2, and updating all related kazari, so for large databases this can take a while.

Using the `-V` option, you just get the current version of TFM.
